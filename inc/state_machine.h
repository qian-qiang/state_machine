/**
 * \mainpage %state_machine
 *
 * %state_machine is a feature-rich, yet simple finite state machine
 * implementation. It supports grouped states, guarded transitions, events
 * with payload, entry and exit actions, transition actions and access to
 * user-defined state data from all actions.
 *
 * The user must build the state machine by linking together states and
 * transitions arrays with pointers. A pointer to an initial state and an
 * error state is given to statem_init() to initialise a state machine object.
 * The state machine is run by passing events to it with the function
 * statem_handle_event(). The return value of statem_handle_event() will
 * give an indication to what has happened.

/**
 * \brief Transition between a state and another state
 *
 * All states that are not final must have at least one transition. The
 * transition may be guarded or not. Transitions are triggered by events. If
 * a state has more than one transition with the same type of event (and the
 * same condition), the first transition in the array will be run. An
 * unconditional transition placed last in the transition array of a state can
 * act as a "catch-all". A transition may optionally run an #action, which
 * will have the triggering event passed to it as an argument, along with the
 * current and new states' \ref state::data "data".
 *
 * It is perfectly valid for a transition to return to the state it belongs
 * to. Such a transition will not call the state's \ref state::action_entry
 * "entry action" or \ref state::action_exti "exit action". If there are no
 * transitions for the current event, the state's parent will be handed the
 * event.
 *
 * ### Examples ###
 * - An ungarded transition to a state with no action performed:
 * ~~~{.c}
 * {
 *    .event_type = Event_timeout,
 *    .condition = NULL,
 *    .guard = NULL,
 *    .action = NULL,
 *    .state_next = &mainMenuState,
 * },
 * ~~~
 * - A guarded transition executing an action
 * ~~~{.c}
 * {
 *    .event_type = EVENT_KEYBOARD,
 *    .condition = NULL,
 *    .guard = &ensureNumericInput,
 *    .action = &addToBuffer,
 *    .state_next = &awaitingInputState,
 * },
 * ~~~
 * - A guarded transition using a condition
 * ~~~{.c}
 * {
 *    .event_type = Event_mouse,
 *    .condition = boxLimits,
 *    .guard = &coordinatesWithinLimits,
 * },
 * ~~~
 * By using \ref #condition "conditions" a more general guard function can be
 * used, operating on the supplied argument #condition. In this example,
 * `coordinatesWithinLimits` checks whether the coordinates in the mouse event
 * are within the limits of the "box".

/**
 * \brief State
 *
 * The current state in a state machine moves to a new state when one of the
 * #transitions in the current state triggers on an event. An optional \ref
 * #action_exti "exit action" is called when the state is left, and an \ref
 * #action_entry "entry action" is called when the state machine enters a new
 * state. If a state returns to itself, neither #action_exti nor #action_entry
 * will be called. An optional \ref transition::action "transition action" is
 * called in either case.
 *
 * States may be organised in a hierarchy by setting \ref #state_parent
 * "parent states". When a group/parent state is entered, the state machine is
 * redirected to the group state's \ref #state_entry "entry state" (if
 * non-NULL). If an event does not trigger a transition in a state and if the
 * state has a parent state, the event will be passed to the parent state.
 * This behaviour is repeated for all parents. Thus all children of a state
 * have a set of common #transitions. A parent state's #action_entry will not
 * be called if an event is passed on to a child state. 
 *
 * The following lists the different types of states that may be created, and
 * how to create them:
 *
 * ### Normal state ###
 * ~~~{.c}
 * struct state normalState = {
 *    .state_parent = &groupState,
 *    .state_entry = NULL,
 *    .transition = (struct transition[]){
 *       { EVENT_KEYBOARD, (void *)(intptr_t)'\n', &keyboard_char_compare,
 *          NULL, &msgReceivedState },
 *    },
 *    .transition_nums = 1,
 *    .data = normalstate_data,
 *    .action_entry = &doSomething,
 *    .action_exti = &cleanUp,
 * };
 * ~~~
 * In this example, `normalState` is a child of `groupState`, but the
 * #state_parent value may also be NULL to indicate that it is not a child of
 * any group state.
 *
 * ### Group/parent state ###
 * A state becomes a group/parent state when it is linked to by child states
 * by using #state_parent. No members in the group state need to be set in a
 * particular way. A parent state may also have a parent.
 * ~~~{.c}
 * struct state groupState = {
 *    .state_entry = &normalState,
 *    .action_entry = NULL,
 * ~~~
 * If there are any transitions in the state machine that lead to a group
 * state, it makes sense to define an entry state in the group. This can be
 * done by using #state_entry, but it is not mandatory. If the #state_entry
 * state has children, the chain of children will be traversed until a child
 * with its #state_entry set to NULL is found.
 *
 * \note If #state_entry is defined for a group state, the group state's
 * #action_entry will not be called (the state pointed to by #state_entry (after
 * following the chain of children), however, will have its #action_entry
 * called).
 *
 * \warning The state machine cannot detect cycles in parent chains and
 * children chains. If such cycles are present, statem_handle_event() will
 * never finish due to never-ending loops.
 *
 * ### Final state ###
 * A final state is a state that terminates the state machine. A state is
 * considered as a final state if its #transition_nums is 0:
 * ~~~{.c}
 * struct state finalState = {
 *    .transitions = NULL,
 *    .transition_nums = 0,
 * ~~~
 * The error state used by the state machine to indicate errors should be a
 * final state. Any calls to statem_handle_event() when the current state is a
 * final state will return #STATEM_STATE_NOCHANGE.
